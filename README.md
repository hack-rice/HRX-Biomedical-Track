# HackRiceX | Biomedical Track

# Track Description

This track is an opportunity to work at the interface between computer science and medicine. People with healthcare interests and backgrounds can use computation and technology to strategize and find creative solutions to health-related problems on a global scale. Tech can be designed to handle large data sets, extrapolate outcomes, and promote good behaviors. 

# Prompt

This track is intentionally broad; weâ€™re open to seeing a broad range of healthcare-related projects. Your goal should be to create something from scratch or improve on an already existing system to address a relevant challenge in medicine. Your deliverable should be a write-up of the problem and the tech behind the prospective solution. Some ideas are
* A software that improves real-time tracking of available resources between hospital systems for better decisions (bed/hospital utilization, PPE, ventilators).
* A social platform that supports disadvantaged communities to more easily identify and access available medical services
